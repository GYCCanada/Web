/**
 * The persisted-`Submission` write service (CONTEXT §Submission, settled #8;
 * registration-launch Branch 7.2). `persist` is the durable half of the
 * submission pipeline — it encodes a decoded form to its `Submission` envelope and
 * `Storage.put`s it at `submissions/<form>/<id>.json`, returning the stored record.
 *
 * Principles (`~/.brain/principles`):
 *
 *   - `small-interface-deep-implementation`: the service exposes exactly ONE
 *     operation — `persist`. It is persistence ONLY: no mailer, no notification.
 *     The bucket write is the durable source of truth; the email is a notification
 *     OF the stored record (CONTEXT §Submission:48), wired as a SEPARATE step in
 *     the generic form action skeleton (Branch 7.3). Splitting `persist` (this
 *     module) from `notify` (the action's terminal step) is what makes
 *     "a notify failure provably cannot lose the record" a real, testable property:
 *     `persist` returns the stored `Submission` BEFORE any notification runs, so a
 *     downstream mailer failure still leaves `submissions/<form>/<id>.json` on the
 *     bucket.
 *
 *   - `derive-dont-sync`: the stored object's payload codec is
 *     `submissionSchema(definition)` — the SAME schema derived from the form's
 *     `FormDefinition` the generic decoder (`decodeForm`, Branch 6.2) validates
 *     submissions against, never a re-declared per-form struct. `persist` reads the
 *     definition through `Content.getForm(form)` (Branch 5.3's CMS-editable read
 *     path), so editing `forms/<form>.json` changes what a stored `Submission` may
 *     hold with no change to this module. The envelope id / storage key are
 *     derived too: `newListItemId()` mints the `<id>` segment, `submissionKey`
 *     derives the bucket key from the closed `FormId` + that id — never hand-typed.
 *
 *   - `make-impossible-states-unrepresentable`: `form` is the closed `FormId`
 *     literal, `submittedAt` is decoded through the branded `IsoDate` (a real
 *     calendar date), `id` is a branded `ListItemId` (nanoid). A `persist` whose
 *     `decoded` payload does not satisfy the form's derived codec is a hard encode
 *     failure (it dies — a decoded form ALWAYS re-encodes, so a failure here is a
 *     bug upstream, not a user error), never a silently half-written object.
 *
 * The service captures `Content` + `Storage` at layer construction (opencode's
 * module-level `export const layer` / `defaultLayer`, vs a `static` member). The
 * only user-facing failure is the bucket write (`StorageError`); a degraded
 * (bucket-less) `Storage` fails the put loudly rather than silently dropping the
 * record (`Storage.layerOptional`'s disabled-write path), which is correct — losing
 * a submission must never look like success.
 */

/**
 * The outcome of committing a registration resubmit through
 * `createOrReuseOrder` (order-workflow round-2 --deep H1). A closed union so the
 * action branches exhaustively:
 *
 *   - `created`: a fresh pending order. The action `arm`s it AND stamps each
 *     registrant `pending` for the first time.
 *   - `reused`: the live pending order is reused (its replayed session). The
 *     ORDER itself is NOT overwritten, but the action DOES re-stamp the
 *     registrants `pending` — a byte-identical idempotent re-stamp that
 *     self-heals a prior submit that wrote the order but failed mid-stamp-loop
 *     (round-3 --deep BLOCKER 2; restamp paths registration-action.ts:420-438,
 *     :538-555). It is NOT re-`arm`ed (the first submit already armed it).
 *   - `alreadyPaid`: returns the existing success/receipt WITHOUT minting a
 *     session, WITHOUT overwriting the paid order, and WITHOUT touching the
 *     registrant stamps (the action skips the stamp loop entirely).
 *
 * `OrderConflict` (case d) is a failure, not an outcome.
